## 0.0 Setup

This guide was written in Python 3.5.

### 0.1 Python & Pip

Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).


### 0.2 Other

We'll soon get into the difference between packages in R and modules in Python. For now, let's install the ones we'll need for this tutorial. Open up your terminal and enter the following commands to install the needed python modules: 

```
pip install ggplot
pip install nltk
pip install seaborn 
```

### 0.3 Virtual Environment

If you'd like to work in a virtual environment, you can set it up as follows: 
```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv your_env
```
And then launch it with: 
```
source your_env/bin/activate
```

To execute the visualizations in matplotlib, do the following:

```
cd ~/.matplotlib
nano matplotlibrc
```
And then, write `backend: TkAgg` in the file. Now you should be set up with your virtual environment!

Cool, now we're ready to start!
